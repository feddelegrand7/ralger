The goal of ralger is to facilitate web scraping in R. 

## Installation


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/ralger")
```
## Example

This is an example which shows how to extract firms' denomination from the website of the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI). For simplicity, we'll focus on firms operating in the capital. 

```{r example}
library(ralger)

my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver"

my_node <- ".listing_default" # see SelectorGadget

scrap_one(my_link, my_node)

```
